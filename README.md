# movie_recommendations

These two files are used to provide recommended movies based on movie title inputs. The recommended movies will be sorted by their Rotten Tomatoes rating (highest to lowest).

This is still a work-in-progress and will be updated as it is completed. At this point, all functions are functional ðŸ™ƒ, just debating on adding more stuff and need to include some comments and function calls at the bottom of the program.
